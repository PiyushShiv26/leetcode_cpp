/*
3980. Minimum Operations to Transform Binary String
Medium

You are given two binary strings s1 and s2 of the same length n.

You can perform the following operations on s1 any number of times, in any order:

Choose an index i such that s1[i] == '0', and change it to '1'.
Choose an index i such that 0 <= i < n - 1, and both s1[i] and s1[i + 1] are '1'. Change both characters to '0'.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make s1 equal to s2. If it is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "11", s2 = "00"
Output: 1
Explanation:
Change indices 0 and 1 from '1' to '0' in one operation, so "11" becomes "00". Thus, the answer is 1.

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "01", s2 = "10"
Output: 3
Explanation:
Change index 0 from '0' to '1', so "01" becomes "11".
Change indices 0 and 1 from '1' to '0', so "11" becomes "00".
Change index 0 from '0' to '1', so "00" becomes "10".
Thus, the answer is 3.

Example 3:

Input: s1 = "1", s2 = "0"
Output: -1
Explanation:
The first operation cannot change '1' to '0', and the second operation requires two adjacent characters. Therefore, it is impossible.

Constraints:

1 <= n == s1.length == s2.length <= 10^5
s1 and s2 consist only of '0' and '1'.
